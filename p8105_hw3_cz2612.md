This is my solution to Homework 3.

## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\!\!

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data.

``` r
accel_df = 
    read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute_raw",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
  separate(minute_raw, into = c("raw", "minute"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
    mutate(
      week = as.integer(week),
      day_id = as.integer(day_id),
      day = as.factor(day),
      day = ordered(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")),
    weekday = case_when(
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday",
      day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend",
      TRUE ~ ""
    ),
      weekday = as.factor(weekday)
    ) %>% 
    select(week:day, weekday, minute, activity_counts)
```

The resulting dataset `accel_df` contains the following 6 variables:
week, day\_id, day, weekday, minute, activity\_counts. It has 50400
observations, and the dimension is 50400 x 6.

Create daily total activity variable and corresponding table.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | day       | total\_activity |
| ---: | :-------- | --------------: |
|    1 | Monday    |        78828.07 |
|    1 | Tuesday   |       307094.24 |
|    1 | Wednesday |       340115.01 |
|    1 | Thursday  |       355923.64 |
|    1 | Friday    |       480542.62 |
|    1 | Saturday  |       376254.00 |
|    1 | Sunday    |       631105.00 |
|    2 | Monday    |       295431.00 |
|    2 | Tuesday   |       423245.00 |
|    2 | Wednesday |       440962.00 |
|    2 | Thursday  |       474048.00 |
|    2 | Friday    |       568839.00 |
|    2 | Saturday  |       607175.00 |
|    2 | Sunday    |       422018.00 |
|    3 | Monday    |       685910.00 |
|    3 | Tuesday   |       381507.00 |
|    3 | Wednesday |       468869.00 |
|    3 | Thursday  |       371230.00 |
|    3 | Friday    |       467420.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |       382928.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |       467052.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |       409450.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |       319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |       434460.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |       340291.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |       154049.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |       260617.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |       389080.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |       367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |       445366.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |       549658.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |       620860.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |       138421.00 |

From the table, we could see that the activities on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays are more stable than other days.

Make a single-panel plot.

``` r
ggp_activity_plot = 
  accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity_counts, color = day)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    title = "Activity counts plot",
    x = "Minute of the day",
    y = "Activity counts",
    caption = "Data from the accel_data.csv file"
  ) + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Day", 
    discrete = TRUE
  )

ggp_activity_plot
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_cz2612_files/figure-gfm/activity_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

From this graph, we could see that the activity counts of night are
normally larger than the activity counts of the daytime, and the
activity counts of midnight are the lowest of all day. Generally
speaking, Friday night and Sunday morning seem to have higher activity
counts than other time.

## Problem 3
